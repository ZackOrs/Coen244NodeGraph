# Coen244NodeGraph

Two types of graphs can be created; Undirected or a Directed graph.

Several functions can be applied to the graph such as adding nodes, vertices, weights, searches, and many others.

A graph can be empty with no vertex or edge.
A graph can be either a directed graph or an undirected graph. 
A graph can be added in vertices and edges.
A vertex of a graph can contain values – in theory, the values can be of any type. 
A graph can be displayed by listing all the possible paths, each linking vertices. 
A graph can be queried by given an edge, if this edge exists in the graph.
A graph can be queried if a value is contained by any of its vertex.
A specific node can have its edge changed.
A Node can be removed, all of it's edges will also be removed from the graph.
An edge can have a weight added.
A graph can have all the weights for the edges printed.
Print the graph using specified values instead of element number.
