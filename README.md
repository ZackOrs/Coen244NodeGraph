# Coen244NodeGraph

This program is used to create a graph that is customizable by the user. These are the functions the program can run. The program will also do checks during runtime to ensure that there are no errors with the inputs. Such as removing repeated edges, making sure the vertices exist for a given edge, etc.

A graph can be empty with no vertex or edge.

A graph can be either a directed graph or an undirected graph. 

A graph can be added in vertices and edges.

A vertex of a graph can contain values â€“ in theory, the values can be of any type. 

A graph can be displayed by listing all the possible paths, each linking vertices. 

A graph can be queried by given an edge, if this edge exists in the graph.

A graph can be queried if a value is contained by any of its vertex.

A specific node can have its edge changed.

A Node can be removed, all of it's edges will also be removed from the graph.

An edge can have a weight added.

A graph can have all the weights for the edges printed.

Print the graph using specified values instead of element number.
